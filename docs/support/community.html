    <h1>Our Community</h1>

    <h2>Welcome to the InfoSecKe Cybersecurity Community</h2>
    <p>
      InfoSecKe is more than an initiative — it’s a living, breathing community of cybersecurity enthusiasts, ethical hackers, students, developers, defenders, bug bounty hunters, and information security professionals. Our mission goes beyond technology; it's about uniting minds around a shared vision of a safer digital future for Kenya and Africa.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Community Matters</h3>
    <p>
      In cybersecurity, knowledge grows exponentially when shared. That’s why we built InfoSecKe as an open platform where members can learn, collaborate, compete, and contribute together. Whether you're a newcomer trying to understand OWASP Top 10, a SOC analyst defending real infrastructure, or a pentester disclosing vulnerabilities — your voice is essential.
